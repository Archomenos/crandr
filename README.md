# crandr
Conditional XRANDR setter for window managers
The project is supposed to take a config file and match the current monitors plugged in to one of these. Afterwards the corresponding configuration is launched.

## State of the project
At the moment it doesn't work perfectly. Not sure why, but it seems to need some seconds after start to work, otherwise it sets complete wrong settings.
